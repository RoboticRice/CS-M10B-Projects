/*These are NOT members of the class due to the following rules of thumb:
* If it is a unary operator, implement it as a member function.
* If a binary operator treats both operands equally (it leaves them unchanged),
  implement this operator as a non-member function.
* If a binary operator does not treat both of its operands equally (usually it 
  will change its left operand), it might be useful to make it a member function
  of its left operandâ€™s type, if it has to access the operand's private parts.
