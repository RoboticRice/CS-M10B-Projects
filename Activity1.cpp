/* 
* Instructions:
* Design a class named Employee . The class should keep the following information:
** Employee name
** Employee number
** Hire date
* Write one or more constructors and the appropriate accessor and mutator functions
* for the class. Next, write a class named ProductionWorker that is derived from
* the Employee class. The ProductionWorker class should have member variables to
* hold the following information:
** Shift (an integer)
** Hourly pay rate (a double )
* The workday is divided into two shifts: day and night. The shift variable will
* hold an integer value representing the shift that the employee works. The day 
* shift is shift 1, and the night shift is shift 2. Write one or more constructors
* and the appropriate accessor and mutator functions for the class. Demonstrate 
* the classes by writing a program that uses a ProductionWorker object.
*//*
* Notes:
* This program does NOT impliment any error handling.
* This program is designed to work with Employee.cpp (Version 0.1) 
                                        & Employee.h (Version 0.2)
