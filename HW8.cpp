/* 
* Instructions:
* Design a class called NumDays that stores a value which represents a number of
* work hours and converts it to a number of days. 
** 8 hours would be converted to 1 day
** 12 hours would be converted to 1.5 days
** 18 hours would be converted to 2.25 days
* The class should have a constructor that accepts a member of hours, as well as
* member functions for storing and retrieving the hours and days. The class 
* should also have the following overloaded operators:
** + Addition operator. When two NumDays objects are added together, the 
   overloaded + operator should return the sum of the two objects’ hours members.
** - Subtraction operator. When one NumDays object is subtracted from another, 
   the overloaded – operator should return the difference of the two objects’  
   hours members.
** ++ Prefix and postfix increment operators. These operators should increment 
   the number of hours stored in the object. When incremented, the number of 
   days should be automatically recalculated.
*** -- Prefix and postfix decrement operators. These operators should decrement 
   the number of hours stored in the object. When decremented, the number of 
   days should be automatically recalculated.
*//*
* Notes:
* This program does NOT impliment any error handling.
* This program is designed to work with NumDays.cpp (Version 0.1)
