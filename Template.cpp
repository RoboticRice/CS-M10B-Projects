* Project: Homework #7, Complex Numbers
* Due on:  20160319

* Class:   CS M10B

/* 
* Instructions:
* Create a class called Complex for performing arithmetic with complex numbers. 
* Complex numbers have the form:
** realPart + imaginaryPart * i
* Where i is sqrt(-1).
*
* Use double variables to represent the private data of the class. Provide a
* constructor that enables an object of this class to be initialized when it is
* declared. The constructor should contain default values in case no initializers
* are provided. Provide public member functions that perform the following tasks:
** Adding two complex numbers: The real parts added together and the imaginary 
   parts are added together.
** Subtracting two complex numbers: The real parts subtracted together and the 
   imaginary parts are subtracted together.
** Printing Complex numbers in the form (a , b), where a is the real part and b 
   is the imaginary part.
*
*Do not use operator overloading for this assignment!
